    <p><b>what is sticky navigationbar?</b></p>
    <p>SomeA sticky menu is a fixed navigation menu on a webpage that remains visible and in the same position as the user scrolls down and moves about a site. Persistent navigation bars – or “sticky headers” – are now a web design standard.</p>
        <p>-> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera fabulas ut quo. Atqui causae gloriatur ius te, id agam omnis evertitur eum. Affert Navigation is an important feature of any website. 
        You want visitors to easily find and engage with your content while maintaining consistency with your website design. The same is true for a WordPress website. Whether you’re running a travel blog, an online store, or a personal portfolio site, you want to ensure your website navigation makes it easier for users to find what they need and become subscribers or customers. 
        Because good navigation enhances your user experience, you can improve dwell time, a critical SEO factor. When visitors browse your website, you want to provide them with easy access to your content.
        Some visitors find it burdensome to scroll back to the top of a page to navigate a website.<br> Sticky menus provide a simple solution to this annoying (and time-consuming) problem. With a fixed navigation bar, visitors can quickly find what they need. It enhances the website experience and entices the visitor to consume more content, resulting in lower bounce rates.

    <p>The type of sticky header you choose for your site depends on your current design and the type of business you own. Most websites would be best served by a top navbar. However, 
            if you’re a creative, you can have some fun with the placement and put it on the left or right.</p>
    <p><b>Fixed top navbar:</b> By far the most common type of navbar, this sticky menu stays fixed at the top of the browser window when a user scrolls down the page. This is ideal for long pages, blog posts, category pages, 
            and virtually any website where users need to scroll. The HubSpot website has a fixed top navbar.</p>
    <p><b>Fixed left navbar:</b> Some brands and websites put their navbar to the left to make the menu items less intrusive or set their website’s design apart. This type of sticky navbar is a better fit for creative businesses, 
            clothing brands, blogs, or websites with a strong modern, contemporary design.</p>
    <p><b>Fixed right navbar:</b>You can create a sticky navigation menu on the right side to bring attention to your menu items. The fixed right navigation menu is unpopular because most people are accustomed to a left-to-right design. That means that the right is the last place users will look. 
            But, you can use this area to add complementary information, such as a cart or a carousel of related articles.</p>
    <p>Sticky navigation works best with retail, eCommerce, and other types of “actionable” sites where the designer intends for a user to take a specific action, 
            such as a click to purchase a product. In those cases, sticky menus have been shown to significantly improve customer experience, by keeping users well-oriented and giving
            them more control over their journey through your site.

        <br>In one example from a well-known retail site (sorry – we can’t release the name), after the brand introduced a sticky navigation bar, its visitors began to scroll further on the page and pay more attention to the individual products on the pages. As a result,
             the company experienced a major reduction in bounce rate, and conversions increased from 30% to 33%, a +10% increase in conversion rate.</p>
    <p>Every brand can benefit from having friendly and intuitive navigation, especially on pages with lots of content that require visitors to scroll. 
        Clear on-page navigation helps visitors make a smooth journey through the content on the page in a manageable way. While “back to top” links can help achieve a similar goal, 
        sticky navigation is a quicker, easier way to let visitors jump to a new page on your site and continue their experience.</p>
        <p>Alongside other interactive navigation techniques, the effectiveness of the sticky element was found to improve the performance in basic selection tasks of older adults and to provide similar benefits (although smaller) to younger users.

            So, why do older adults and younger users respond better to sticky navigation? It's because of the relatively lower confidence levels of older adults and much younger users on the web and their subsequent need for additional support, 
            which sticky navigation provides. Older adults and young users respond well to the confidence that sticky navigation menus instill.</p>
    <p>This is where the psychology of web design and user experience comes into play. Sticky menu elements increase visitors’ confidence as they scroll up and down a page, giving them a sense of control while interacting with a website.
         They know what their options are and have no reason to feel uneasy because everything they might need is right in front of them.</p>
         <p>A 2020 Contentsquare and CommerceNEXT survey of 1,000 online shoppers revealed customers list the ease of finding what they’re looking for as the third most important factor when picking where to online shop, following price and deals/promotions. 
            Thirty-eight percent of customers also said when a website is easy to navigate, they are more likely to shop there again in the future.</p>
            <p>People like feeling in control. Imagine a situation where you are unaware of what is happening around you. Very quickly, the “stress” button is switched on and you try to do everything you can to regain control. You can achieve this by ‘sticking’ to something
                 or somewhere that’s familiar, adopting an old pattern of behavior, or relying on someone you trust.</p>
                 <p>The same logic can be applied to web navigation and the digital experience. Visitors can feel lost trying to find their way through very long webpages. In most cases, this feeling will trigger stress that will cause them to leave the site, or bounce. 
                    This is exactly the purpose of sticky navigation: to help people explore a webpage in a comfortable and controlled manner.</p>
                    <p>Navigation bars are probably the best way to allow users navigate around your websites effortlessly without getting lost.

                        People usually place navbars at the very top of the page, but you can also put a navbar on either side of your webpage if it compliments your design.
                         Navbars can either be a horizontal list of nav items or hamburger-style at the top-left or top-right corners of webpages on smaller screens.<br>
                        
                        To allow better accessibility to navbars, you can sticky them at the top by using a few lines of CSS and JavaScript. 
                        More JavaScript code can become piled up as the complexity of the navbar increases.
                        
                        In this post, we’ll see how you can create a custom sticky navbar that is responsive to all screen sizes with great functionality, using only CSS to create it.
                         We’ll also learn how to use the SCSS’s syntactic sugar to write our CSS code much faster and cleaner.</p>
